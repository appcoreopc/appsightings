What is appsightings - just like ghost sightings you get to see things ppl don't see. 

###  Problem it is trying to solve
- we all know how to code, but sometimes we don't know 100% percent for sure how the program actually works.

It scans your entire assembly, give you more insights in what your app actually does. 

How is it different from application insights from Azure. 

For one, it only works for Azure based app.  This gives better and faster insights into your app as you're doing debugging. 
It might takes around 2-5 minutest some data out from Azure.

There is more than one way to do tracing. The best way is to run from the start. But sometimes you need tracing to be done from a specific sets of codes.
